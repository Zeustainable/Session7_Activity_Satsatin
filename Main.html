                  I reside in Imus, Cavite, and my passion lies in exploring the dynamic world of technology. I am eager to expand my knowledge and 
                  contribute to the ever-evolving field of IT.

                  kindergarten, and preparatory levels. These foundational years in pre-school laid the groundwork for my academic exploration and ignited 
                  the spark of curiosity that continues to drive my learning today.

                  school holds a special place in my heart as the sacred space where I received my first communion and confirmation, marking significant 
                  milestones in my spiritual growth. It was a nurturing environment that contributed to both my academic and personal development during 
                  those foundational years.

                  from my junior high school. During my senior high school years, I delved into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) 
                  as my strand and proudly maintained a consistent honor status, ultimately graduating with high honors. The nurturing environment here has 
                  played a crucial role in shaping my academic journey.
